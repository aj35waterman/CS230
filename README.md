The Gaming Room is a company that wanted to take their Android game Draw It or Lose It and expand it to work on the web across multiple platforms. 
They needed the game to support multiple teams and players, have timed rounds, and use unique names and IDs to manage everything. I designed a Java-based 
solution using object-oriented programming and the Singleton pattern to make sure only one instance of the game service runs. I also included a clear domain 
model and followed their technical needs closely. I think I did well organizing the design document and clearly showing how each part of the game connects. 
The UML diagram made the structure easy to follow. Working through the design first helped me plan better before jumping into code. If I could improve anything, 
I’d go back and add more details to the system architecture section. I focused on the user’s needs by making sure the design was simple, scalable, and easy to 
update later. In the future, I’ll keep using strategies like breaking the problem into parts, modeling relationships, and using design patterns to stay organized.
